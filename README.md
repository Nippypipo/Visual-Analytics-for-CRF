# Visual-Analytics-for-CRF

This project involved the creation of an interactive dashboard 📊 to analyze the performance of a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model trained for Thai address extraction 🇹🇭. The dashboard provides insights ✨ into the model's accuracy in identifying key address components, particularly provinces.

## Key Visualizations

Province Prediction Accuracy: A bar chart 📈 visualizing the percentage of correct province predictions ✅, along with the frequency of each province in the dataset. This allows for a direct comparison 🔍 of prediction success across different provinces.
Incorrect Province Tagging: A stacked bar chart 📊 illustrating the percentage of times each province (LOC tag📍) was incorrectly predicted as other tags ❌. This highlights common misclassifications.
Surrounding Word Tagging Analysis: A 100% stacked bar chart 💯 showing the distribution of predicted tag categories for words surrounding correctly 👍 and incorrectly 👎 identified O, ADDR, and POST tags 🏷️. This helps understand the contextual factors 🤔 influencing prediction accuracy.
Interactive Features:

Regional Filtering: Users can filter ⚙️ the visualizations to focus on specific regions: Bangkok and Metropolitan area 🏙️, and other provinces 🏞️.
Details-on-Demand: Hovering 🖱️ over elements in the visualizations reveals additional information ℹ️. For example, hovering over a segment in the "Incorrect Province Tagging" chart displays the specific incorrect tag and its percentage for that province.
Sortable Province Accuracy Chart: The "Province Prediction Accuracy" bar chart can be sorted ⇅ in ascending or descending order based on the accuracy rate.
Data and Task:

The dataset utilized was derived from the pythainlp/thainer-corpus-v2.2 📚. The original NER tags B-LOCATION and I-LOCATION for provinces, sub-districts, and districts were unified into a single LOC tag 📍. Similarly, B-ZIP was relabeled as POST 📮 to align with the model's predicted tags and facilitate analysis. Thai province, sub-district, and district data from https://github.com/ThepExcel/download/blob/master/ThepExcel-Thailand-Tambon.xlsx 🔗 was used for this tag transformation.

## Insights and Findings

Our initial hypothesis 💡 was that the CRF model would perform less accurately on provinces outside of Bangkok and its vicinity. The developed analytical system 🔎 confirmed this hypothesis:

Regional Accuracy Disparity: The "Province Prediction Accuracy" chart 📈, in conjunction with the regional filter ⚙️, clearly demonstrates a higher percentage of correct LOC predictions ✅ for Bangkok and Metropolitan provinces 🏙️ compared to other provinces 🏞️. Furthermore, when examining performance by region, the Northern region ⬆️ showed the highest accuracy among non-Bangkok areas, while other regions exhibited similar performance. The "Incorrect Province Tagging" chart 📊 further revealed that incorrect LOC predictions frequently resulted in the ADDR tag.
Frequency vs. Accuracy: The "Province Prediction Accuracy" bar chart 📈 indicated that the frequency 🔢 of a province's appearance in the dataset did not directly correlate with the model's prediction accuracy for that province 🤔.
Contextual Tagging Patterns: Analysis of the surrounding words for misclassified POST tags 🏷️ showed a prevalence of the URL tag 🌐. Conversely, correctly identified POST tags 📮 were often surrounded by B-LOCATION or I-LOCATION tags 📍, as evidenced by the "Surrounding Word Tagging Analysis" chart 💯.
